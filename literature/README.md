# Papers to READ

These were suggested by Andrew Morgan to help formalise the manuscript on trend-calculus.

The indicator on tradingview:

Andrew Morgan's aside:

- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-system

I also highly recommend thinking about L-Systems  and whether TrendCalculus discovered StreamOrders of reversals is sort of like the inverse of L-Systems.

If so -- my hypothesis -- is that perhaps we could construct an L-System, from configuration data discovered by TrendCalculus. 
Given the possibility is feasible -- might that be a new way to forecast a time series?
